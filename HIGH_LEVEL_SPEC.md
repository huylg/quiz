# Real-Time Vocabulary Quiz Coding Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the Real-Time Quiz coding challenge! Your task is to create a technical solution for a real-time quiz feature for an English learning application. This feature will allow users to answer questions in real-time, compete with others, and see their scores updated live on a leaderboard.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **User Participation**:
   - Users should be able to join a quiz session using a unique quiz ID.
   - The system should support multiple users joining the same quiz session simultaneously.

2. **Real-Time Score Updates**:
   - As users submit answers, their scores should be updated in real-time.
   - The scoring system must be accurate and consistent.

3. **Real-Time Leaderboard**:
   - A leaderboard should display the current standings of all participants.
   - The leaderboard should update promptly as scores change.

## Requirements

### Part 1: System Design

- **Architecture Diagram**: Create an architecture diagram illustrating component interactions (server, client apps, database, real-time communication layer, etc.).
- **Component Description**: Describe each component's role.
- **Data Flow**: Explain how data flows through the system from when a user joins a quiz to when the leaderboard is updated.
- **Technologies and Tools**: List and justify the technologies and tools chosen for each component.

### Part 2: Implementation

- **Real-time Quiz Participation**: Users should be able to join a quiz session using a unique quiz ID.
- **Real-time Score Updates**: Users' scores should be updated in real-time as they submit answers.
- **Real-time Leaderboard**: A leaderboard should display the current standings of all participants in real-time.

### Part 3: Nonfunctional requirements

- **Scalability**: Design and implement your component with scalability in mind. Consider how the system would handle a large number of users or quiz sessions. Discuss any trade-offs you made in your design and implementation.
- **Performance**: Your component should perform well even under heavy load. Consider how you can optimize your code and your use of resources to ensure high performance.
- **Reliability**: Your component should be reliable and handle errors gracefully. Consider how you can make your component resilient to failures.
- **Maintainability**: Your code should be clean, well-organized, and easy to maintain. Consider how you can make it easy for other developers to understand and modify your code.
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Discuss how you would monitor the performance of your component and diagnose issues. Consider how you can make your component observable.
